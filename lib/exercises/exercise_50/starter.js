/*
EXERCISE 50:

		Create a function called "build2D" that takes a parameter called num (a non-negative number) and builds a 2D array with the dimensions num * num
			starting with the number 1 and incrementing by 1 for each.

        For example:
        
		build2D(1) should return [[1]]
		
		build2d(2) should return [[1,2],[3,4]]

		build2d(0) should return []

		build2d(3) should return [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
*/
