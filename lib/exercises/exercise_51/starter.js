/*
EXERCISE 51:

		Create a function called "build2DWithIdx" that takes a parameter called num (a non-negative number) and builds a 2D array with the dimensions num * num
			and filling in each sub-element with a string of the row index next to the column index.

        For example:
        
		build2D(1) should return [['00']]
		
		build2d(2) should return [['00','01'],['10','11']]

		build2d(0) should return []

		build2d(3) should return [['01','02','03']',['10','11','12']',['20','21','22']]
*/

function build2DWithIdx(num) {}
