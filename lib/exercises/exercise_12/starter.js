/*
EXERCISE 12:

        Write a function called "getAppearances" that takes two parameters called "arr" and "input" and returns the total number of times "input" appears in "arr";
        
        For example:

        getAppearances([1,2,3,2,6,2],2) should return 3
        getAppearances([1,2,3,4],5) should return 0
        getAppearances(['eeny','meeny','miney','moe'],'moe') should return 1
*/

function getAppearances(arr,input){
    var val = 1;
    return val;
}
