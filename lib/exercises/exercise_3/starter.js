/*
EXERCISE 3:

        Write a small function called "lengthAnnouncer" that takes a parameter called "str" and returns the length of the string in the following format:

            "<str> has <str length> characters!"
        
        For example:

        lengthAnnouncer('Sand') should return 'Sand has 4 characters!'
        lengthAnnouncer('Bob') should return 'Bob has 3 characters!'
        lengthAnnouncer('dream big') should return 'dream big has 9 characters!'
*/

function lengthAnnouncer(str){
    var val = 'test';
    return val;
}
