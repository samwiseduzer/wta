/*
EXERCISE 46:

		Using the ES2015 class syntax, create a class called Person with a constructor setting the properties 
			"name", "weight", and "age", and a default property called "isAlive" set to true
		Additionally, add a method called greet() that takes a parameter "name" and returns a string in the format 
			"Hi, <name>, my name is <person's name>!" without using concatenation

        For example:
        
        const myPerson = new Person('Steve',160,35);
		//myPerson should be {name: 'Steve', weight: 160, age: 35, isAlive: true}
		
		myPerson.greet('Bob');
		//should return "Hi, Bob, my name is Steve!"
